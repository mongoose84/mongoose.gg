    Never help loosing teammate
    Bad players will always loose, even with help

    Always go for guaranteed gold
    Choose gold and towers over gank and drake

    Speed matters
    Clear minions/camps faster to give more time to roam
    Combine with nr. 2
    Leave lost battles early

    Abuse dead time (the time between minions/camps)
    Use it for ganks, recalling, etc

    Spend, dont save
    Time your recalls with the items you can get
    Match recall with enemy if you are 75% hp and 50% mana to not be behind when they get back
    fx. recall on 800 and 1200 to get the items you need, but be careful not to die in lane

    Never assume your teammates intentions
    Wait for them to commit, before going yourself

    Dont force
    Avoid to be the one in front. As a tank, stay close to teammates to not get cought out
    Dont assume teammates will be good in teamfights.
    Counterengaging is easier, wait for them to use their cooldowns

    Push to punish
    Dont contest drake if no vision instead hard push a lane
    Dont help jungle if drake is not contested

    Dont fight fair
    Only fight if you have a numbers or health advantage
    Roam everytime you have pushed a lane
    If the fight is even, use rule 7) dont force

    Baron before inhibitors
    does not mean we need to take baron, but we start it to lure in the enemy.
    If the enemy team dont come, we take baren
    if the enemy comes, we turn and wipe them, again using rule 7) letting them engage
